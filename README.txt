C++ Dragon Game README

This game was made during Codecademy course "Learn C++"

The project was to create a text adventure using the conditional
logic learnt so far on the course.

I believe it may be more concise to write the code using functions,
but as yet, functions have not yet been introduced on the course.

As and when this is introduced I may revisit this game and update it using functions
